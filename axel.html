    <b>OH DEAR GOD WHAT IS THAT WHAT THE FUCK WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY</b><br><br><br>
	Oh no. It's a Sonic OC: the internet's greatest fear.
	<br><br>So let me introduce you to this creature who I have forced into existence against their own will:<br><br>
	<a href="./img/axel.png"  target="_blank"><img src="./img/axel_thumbnail.png"><a><br><br>
	Artwork above by the amazing @Tur0d on Twitter.<br><br>
	This is Axel, a Mobian fox. (who also may or may not be a fox because of my tails obsession sshh)<br><br>
	Axel has a very sleepy personality, hence the swirly eyes. Their voice will probably make you fall asleep, so be prepared to hear them talk about the Linux kernel for 3 hours. That is, unless they fall asleep mid conversation.<br><br>
  Their dreams are either insanely weird or literal nightmare fuel. There is no in-between.<br><br>
  Axel's fur is in a weird crystal-like pattern, kind of like Mephiles. Why are they purple? It mainly has to do with my obsession with that color, which is a recurring theme with my other OCs. I also really like pinkish-red, so that's why that's there.<br><br>
  They also like to hide their mouth under their insanely fluffy neck.<br><br>
  They try to act edgy but they fail really badly at trying to not act cute.<br><br>
